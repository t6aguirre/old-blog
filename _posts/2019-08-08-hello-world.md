Hey! I’m Tomas Aguirre Lessa Vaz

I’m a Brazillian undergrad student that is in love by Economics and Computer Science. And this is my blog. In here, I intend to write about academic things that I’m interesting of and to talk a little bit about my personal projects. On the way, I want to practice my English writing and to get more familiarized with tools as GitHub, Markdown and Jekyll 

Hope you'll enjoy
