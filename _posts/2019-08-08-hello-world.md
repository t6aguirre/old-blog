Hey! I’m Tomas Aguirre Lessa Vaz. 

I’m a Brazillian undergrad student that is in love by Economics and Computer Science. And this is my blog. In here, I intend to write about academic things that I’m interesting of and to talk a little bit about my personal projects. On the way, I want to practice my English writing and to get my familiarized with with GitHub, Markdown, Jekyll and. 

Hope you'll enjoy
