I just began learning university-level introductory statistics and probability. And I want to do it with a hands-on approach and using the best resources avaible online. Three of the main resources that I will use are: 

[Computerphile's Playlist Data Analysis with Dr Mike Pound](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzH6n4zXuckpfMu_4Ff8E7Z1behQks5ba)
An amazing -- and short -- introduction to data analysis with R by Computerphile, a YouTube channel about Computer Science based on the University of Nottingham.

[Seeing Theory](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/)
Nothing like a good vizualization to finally grasp a hard mathematical concept (btw, I love you, 3Blue1Brown). This site, which started as an undergrad project at Brown University, is a perfect examples of that. 

[OpenIntro Statistics Open Textbooks](https://www.openintro.org/)
In an enthusiast of open textbooks. I believe that they are one of the many things that aren't suit for restrictive intellectual property rights. And, for me, the OpenIntro is a great example of that. 

Alongside with them, I will also follow my syllabus at the University of Sao Paulo and use some resources from [MIT Open Course Warehouse](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/index.htm)
