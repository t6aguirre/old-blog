I just began learning undergraduate level introductory statistics and probability. And I want to do it with a hands-on approach and using the best resources avaible online. Three of the main resources that I will use are: 

[Computerphile's Playlist Data Analysis with Dr Mike Pound](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzH6n4zXuckpfMu_4Ff8E7Z1behQks5ba) -
An amazing - and short - introduction to data analysis with R by Computerphile, a YouTube channel about Computer Science based at the University of Nottingham.

[Seeing Theory](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/) - 
Nothing like a good visualization to finally grasp a hard mathematical concept (btw, I love you, 3Blue1Brown). This site, which started as an undergrad project at Brown University, is a perfect examples of that. 

[OpenIntro Statistics Open Textbooks](https://www.openintro.org/) -
In an enthusiast of open textbooks. And this is a great one. I had studied the first hundred pages of it two years ago, in the middle of high school. Now, let's get to the end of it. 

Alongside with these links, I’ll also follow my syllabus at the University of Sao Paulo (unfortunately --  and unusually -- , they don’t have a recent open syllabus of this subject) and use some resources from [MIT Open Course Warehouse](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-05-introduction-to-probability-and-statistics-spring-2014/index.htm) 

If you know any other resources for learning introductory staticis and probabilty, please, message me!
