A short overview of this emerging interdisciplinary field

In which interesting ways economics and linguistics intersect? What these two disciplines have to gain by deepening an up to now very superficial dialogue? With these questions in mind I explored a bit the existing literature about it. What came out of this short exploration is: *Both economics and linguistics are interested ultimately in how we make decisions and interact with each other, creating complex social structures on the way. Because of that, both disciplines have many analogue structures and the insights of one of them may help the other to further develop.* 

One can be studied by the point of view of the other (i.e. economics of language; language of economics), but they also can work together in a more symbiotic way. Additionally, in the last decades, they both gained important new insights from psychology, with behavioural economics, in one hand, and cognitive linguistics, on the other. One might even try to put them both disciplines under the umbrella of cognitive sciences.
