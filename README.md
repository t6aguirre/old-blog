## About me 


Hey! I’m Tomas Aguirre Lessa Vaz

I’m a Brazilian undergrad student that is in love with Economics and Computer Science. And this is my blog. In here, I intend to write about academic things that I’m interesting of and to talk a little bit about my personal projects. Along the way, I want to practice my English writing and to get more familiarized with tools as GitHub, Markdown and Jekyll

Hope you’ll enjoy
