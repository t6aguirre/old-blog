### About me 


Hey! I'm Tomás Aguirre

I’m a Economics undergrad student at the University of São Paulo. And this is my blog. Here, I write about academic issues that I am interested in and I also talk about a little of my personal projects. Along the way, I want to practice my writing and to get more familiarized with some programming tools.

Hope you enjoy
