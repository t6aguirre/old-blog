### About me 


Hey! I'm Tomás Aguirre

I’m an Economics undergrad student at the University of São Paulo. And this is my blog. Here, I’ll write about academic issues that interest me, and I’ll also talk about my personal projects. Along the way, I want to practice my writing and to get more familiarized with some programming tools.
I hope you enjoy it.
